    This extension is for all those people who hate having to press Command-F when they want to find words on a web page. With TypeFind installed, you can shrug off that burden. Just start typing what you want to find, and TypeFind will highlight the first matching text on the page, scrolling to it if necessary. Pressing Tab will jump to the next occurrence; Shift-Tab to the previous one. If the found text is (part of) a link, pressing Enter will open the link.</p>

<p>
    The extension has just one option: You can require that a trigger key be pressed before TypeFind will start paying attention to what you type. The default trigger key is &ldquo;/&rdquo;, but you can change it to any other single character. Warning: If you enable the trigger key, the difference between using TypeFind and using Command-F becomes even slighter.</p>
