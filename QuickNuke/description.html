	This little Safari extension lets you hide ("nuke") any element on a web page quickly and easily. Hidden elements do not take up space on the page. Changes are temporary; if you reload the page, the hidden elements will be visible again.</p>
<p>
	So, what's it good for? Perhaps the best use of QuickNuke is to remove unwanted parts of a page before printing it. And there are times when something on a web page just really bugs the crap out of you, but you don't want to bother setting up an <a href="http://safariadblock.com/" target="_blank">AdBlock</a> rule for that element because you don't plan to visit that site ever again.</p>
<p>
	Speaking of AdBlock, I don't want to duplicate its functionality&mdash;so there are no plans to implement persistent element hiding in a future version of QuickNuke. If that's what you're looking for, you might give <a href="/quickstyle">Quickstyle</a> a try.</p>
<p>
	Oh, by the way&mdash;QuickNuke has one other feature, which is sort of the opposite of its main purpose: You can use it to "isolate" an element on the page&mdash;that is, to hide everything <em>except</em> that element. This can be useful when you really want to focus on one thing, or when you want to print just one thing, like an article body or a table. This feature is only accessible using the "extended mode" (see below).</p>

<h4 id="howtouse">How to use</h4>
<p>
	There are two ways to use QuickNuke. The first method ("Quick Mode") is best suited to quickly hiding a single element, while the second method ("Extended Mode") is better for hiding several elements one after another.</p>

<h5>Method 1 (Quick Mode)</h5> 
<ol>
	<li>Click the element you want to remove, and <em>keep the mouse button down</em>.</li>
	<li>Press <strong>D</strong>. A magenta highlight will appear around the targeted element, showing you exactly which element will be hidden.</li>
	<li>Release the mouse button to hide the element.</li>
</ol>
<p>
	There are a couple of things you can do while the mouse button is still down. You can:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Press <strong>D</strong> to target the element's parent element. Press <strong>D</strong> repeatedly to target ancestors higher up the chain.</li>
	<li>Press <strong>E</strong> after pressing D to go back down a generation.</li>
	<li>Press <strong>R</strong> or <strong>Esc</strong> to cancel the whole operation.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Method 2 (Extended Mode)</h5>
<ol>
	<li>Press <strong>Command-Option-K</strong> to enter extended mode. (You can change this hotkey in the extension manager.)</li>
	<li>Move the mouse over the element you want to hide. A magenta highlight will appear on the element under the mouse.</li>
	<li>Press the space bar to hide the highlighted element.</li>
	<li>Highlight and hide additional elements as desired.</li>
	<li>When done, press <strong>Esc</strong> to exit extended mode.</li>
</ol>
<p>
	As in the Quick method, you can press <strong>D</strong> to target the highlighted element's parent, or press <strong>E</strong> to get back to its child element. Also, you can press <strong>Enter</strong> to hide the currently highlighted element and exit extended mode at the same time.</p>
<p>
	To isolate an element, highlight it and press <strong>I</strong>. When you want to exit isolation mode, press Esc or click the Return button at the top of the page.</p>
<p>
	Finally, you can restore all nuked elements on the page by using the context menu command, <strong>Restore All Nuked Elements</strong>.</p>

<h4>Tip</h4>
<p>
	QuickNuke has an optional toolbar button that's hidden by default. The button initiates (or exits) extended mode. To enable it, you have to customize your toolbar. Right-click the toolbar, select “Customize…”, and drag the QuickNuke button (it looks like a fat X) to your toolbar.</p>
